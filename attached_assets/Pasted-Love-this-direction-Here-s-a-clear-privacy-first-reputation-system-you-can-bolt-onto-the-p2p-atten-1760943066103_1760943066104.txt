Love this direction. Here’s a clear, privacy-first reputation system you can bolt onto the p2p attention market without getting creepy or gameable.

What we’re scoring (two sides)

Sender reputation (can I be trusted to reach people?)
	•	Are my messages opened quickly?
	•	Do I get replies?
	•	Do recipients rate my messages as useful?
	•	Do I behave well (few blocks, few refunds)?

Recipient reputation (is this inbox worth paying to reach?)
	•	Do they open on time?
	•	Do they reply when there’s a bounty/SLA?
	•	Do they refund fairly if they don’t engage?
	•	Do senders rate the interaction positively?

All of this is keyed to the Self nullifier (unique-per-person, no PII).

⸻

Events you already have (the raw signals)
	•	message.sent (has bid, tags, sender_nullifier, recipient_nullifier)
	•	message.delivered (won a slot)
	•	message.opened (timestamp)
	•	message.replied (timestamp)
	•	message.refunded (reason: unopened, blocked, expired)
	•	recipient.blocked(sender)
	•	sender.vouched_by(recipient) (optional)
	•	bounty.paid (if reply within SLA)
	•	quick-rating (1-tap emoji from either side after an interaction)

You don’t need ratings text—just counts. Keep it minimal and private.

⸻

MVP scoring (simple, robust, hard to game)

1) Use rates with confidence, not raw ratios

Small samples lie. Use the Wilson lower bound (95%) for any “success rate” metric so new accounts can’t fake a 100% with 1–2 interactions.
	•	open_rate_LB over last 90 days
	•	reply_rate_LB over last 90 days
	•	positive_rating_LB (quick reactions)

2) Add a few friction signals
	•	refund_rate (lower is better)
	•	block_rate (lower is better)
	•	SLA_met_rate for recipients (opened/replied within declared SLA)
	•	net_contribution for senders (paid – refunded) per message, capped (prevents pay-to-win)

3) Decay everything gently

Recent behavior matters more. Exponential decay with a 60–90 day half-life keeps scores fresh.

Sender score (0–100), example

sender_score =
  45 * reply_rate_LB +
  20 * open_rate_LB +
  10 * positive_rating_LB +
   8 * vouch_score +
  -6 * refund_rate +
  -7 * block_rate +
   5 * contribution_score

	•	reply_rate_LB dominates (quality)
	•	vouch_score = sum of vouches weighted by the voucher’s own reputation (capped)
	•	contribution_score = normalized net_contribution per delivered msg, clipped so money can’t brute-force the score

Recipient score (0–100), example

recipient_score =
  40 * SLA_met_rate_LB +
  30 * reply_rate_LB_when_bounty +
  15 * open_rate_LB +
 -10 * refund_rate +
  10 * positive_rating_LB

Keep weights human-readable so you can tune by eye after week 1.

⸻

Vouching (social proof without doxxing)
	•	Lightweight vouches: Any recipient can “vouch” a sender after a good exchange.
	•	Weighted vouches: A vouch from a highly-rated recipient is worth more (e.g., 1.0 pt) than from a new or low-rated account (e.g., 0.2 pt).
	•	Slashing: If a sender gets blocked by many recipients soon after being vouched, the vouch loses weight (discourages careless vouching).
	•	Caps: Max vouch impact = 8–10 points on the sender score (prevents circles from inflating to the moon).

This mirrors your “VouchLines” thinking but keeps it simple.

⸻

Topic-aware reputation (optional but powerful)

Store counts per tag (e.g., hiring, fundraising, support, local). Then compute tag-specific scores with the same recipe.
Recipients can weight tags in their inbox settings (e.g., “Boost hiring by +0.3”). This keeps relevance high without extra complexity.

⸻

Transparency in the UI (tiny, honest badges)

Show 3–5 plain-English facts instead of a mysterious number:

For senders
	•	“Opens: 78% (confident) · Replies: 41% (confident)”
	•	“5 trusted vouches · 0 blocks in 90d”
	•	“Verified human (Self)”

For recipients
	•	“Opens in ~2h (P90) · Replies 36% w/ bounty”
	•	“Refunds if unopened (24h)”
	•	“Trusted by 12 senders”

Use a small color badge (Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum) derived from the 0–100 score, but let users expand to see the facts.

⸻

Anti-gaming guardrails (simple rules that work)
	•	One-per-recipient throttle: A sender’s attempts to the same recipient escalate in cost and don’t add rep if repeated within 24h.
	•	No pay-to-win: Payments only affect delivery and a small contribution_score capped to a couple points.
	•	Mutual-admiration cap: Limit how much two accounts can boost each other (vouch and rating influence capped per pair per month).
	•	Cold-start fairness: New verified humans start at a neutral 50 with a “New” badge; their score can only rise fast on delivered + replied interactions (not on bids).

⸻

Privacy & integrity (your stack makes this easy)
	•	Key by Self nullifier; never store PII.
	•	Daily Merkle root of interaction events anchored on-chain (or a signed digest) so scores are auditable later.
	•	Use TEE Shield patterns to attest the frontend hash (“this UI is legit”) and sign your scoring job outputs.
	•	If you want public proofs later, adapt ShadowVault-style ZK patterns to prove aggregate stats (e.g., “reply_rate ≥ 30%”) without leaking raw counts.

⸻

Rollout plan (one week, incremental)

Day 1–2 — MVP metrics
	•	Log events; compute Wilson-bound open/reply rates; add exponential decay.
	•	Show badges + 3 facts in composer and inbox.

Day 3–4 — Vouches + blocks
	•	Add one-click vouch/block; weight vouches by recipient score with caps; display “Trusted by N.”

Day 5 — SLAs + refunds
	•	Let recipients declare an SLA (e.g., open ≤ 24h); measure it and reward with a badge.
	•	Automatic refunds for unopened messages after SLA; this feeds refund_rate.

Day 6–7 — Tag-aware scores
	•	Track per-tag counts; compute tag-specific rates; expose a simple “interests” control in settings.

⸻

Quick formulas (copyable)

Wilson lower bound (95%):
For successes s out of n, p̂ = s/n, z = 1.96

LB = ( p̂ + z²/(2n) - z * sqrt( (p̂(1-p̂) + z²/(4n)) / n ) ) / (1 + z²/n)

Exponential decay weight for event at age t days, half-life H:

w = 0.5^( t / H )

Apply w to counts before computing rates (so recent actions weigh more).

⸻

Where the repos fit
	•	Self-x402: identity (Self proof → nullifier) + tiny payments; also gives you clean request/response patterns for gating and refunds.
	•	TEE-Shield: sign/attest the UI and score outputs to prevent spoofing and “score swapping.”
	•	ShadowVault (later): ZK proofs of aggregates if you want public verifiability without revealing raw data.
	•	Frames scaffolds: easy “Message me” entry that shows badges + price quote in a Farcaster Frame.

If you want, I can plug your current event names into a tiny scoring script and hand you a ready-to-drop /scores endpoint spec (inputs, outputs, and the JSON your UI expects).
