got it — here’s a crisp, ready-to-paste landing-page copy set that refines your message and keeps it simple, while nodding to the tech.

Hero (pick 1)

A. Get paid for your attention.
B. Your inbox, but with a price.
C. Pay-to-message, powered by your time.

Subhead:
x4pp is a peer-to-peer messaging attention market. Anyone can send you a DM by placing a bid in USDC on Celo. Funds only move if you open before the deadline (EIP-3009 deferred authorization).

Primary CTA: Open your inbox
Secondary CTA: Try a demo

⸻

One-liner (elevator pitch)

x4pp lets anyone monetize their demand, time, and attention with a simple URL—perfect for creators, influencers, founders, and beyond.

⸻

Value props (short & clear)
	•	Simple URL: Share x4pp.xyz/@you to receive paid DMs from anyone.
	•	No escrow drama: Money stays with the sender until you open.
	•	Open bidding: Senders pick their price; you decide what’s worth opening.
	•	Any wallet, no signup: Message any Celo address—even if they haven’t claimed an inbox yet.

⸻

How it works (3 steps each)

For receivers
	1.	Claim your inbox with your wallet.
	2.	Set a minimum price.
	3.	Open bids you like → instant USDC to your wallet; ignore the rest and they expire.

For senders
	1.	Pick a username or wallet address.
	2.	See a price guide (min / typical / high) and place your bid.
	3.	Sign a gasless authorization; if the recipient opens in time, USDC transfers—otherwise nothing moves.

⸻

Who it’s for (examples)
	•	Celebrities & influencers: Filter noise, keep only what’s valuable.
	•	CEOs & operators: Prioritize real opportunities over cold spam.
	•	Creators & consultants: Turn inbound requests into paid time.
	•	Communities & DAOs: Gate attention fairly without KYC.

⸻

Tech note (one sentence, friendly)

Runs on Celo + USDC with EIP-3009 “sign-to-authorize” payments and a facilitator that settles only when you open. No funds move until you say so.

⸻

Roadmap teaser (AI agents)

Soon: a marketplace for AI agents—let agents bid to deliver services (summaries, research, intros) directly into your paid inbox.

⸻

Microcopy you can sprinkle in
	•	“No funds move unless you open.”
	•	“Gasless for senders. Receiver (or relayer) pays gas on accept.”
	•	“One active bid per sender → spam collapses.”
	•	“Unopened bids auto-expire—no refund step needed.”

⸻
