Short answer: I can’t read your React landing page’s content directly (it’s rendered client-side, so my fetch returns an empty HTML shell). So I can’t grade the exact copy that’s live.

That said, here’s a tight, step-by-step checklist and drop-in copy to ensure x4pp’s page clearly communicates the value, and references the tech/innovation you’re using (Celo + USDC, EIP-3009 deferred auth, Self-x402 facilitator). If your page already does most of this, great—just skim the gaps.

What the landing page must do (quick checklist)

Above the fold (first screen)
	•	Clear one-line value prop for both sides:
	•	Receivers: “Get paid to read DMs.”
	•	Senders: “Reach any wallet, no signup—pay only if opened.”
	•	Subhead that names the tech edge (in plain English).
	•	Primary CTA (“Open your inbox” / “Try a demo”) + secondary CTA (“How it works”).
	•	One sentence of safety: “Funds don’t move unless the receiver opens.”

Middle of page
	•	3-step how-it-works for Senders and Receivers (separate columns).
	•	“Why it’s different” (open bidding, no custodial escrow, gasless auth for sender).
	•	“Under the hood” tech box (Celo USDC + EIP-3009 + deferred settle via Self-x402 Facilitator).
	•	Social proof / credibility (logos, tiny roadmap, or a short quote).

Bottom
	•	FAQ (gas fees, expiry/refund, messaging any wallet, security/privacy).
	•	Clear secondary CTA.
	•	Links to docs/GitHub.

Drop-in copy (feel free to paste/tweak)

Hero

Headline:
Get paid for your attention.

Subhead:
x4pp is a peer-to-peer DM inbox where senders bid to message you in USDC on Celo. Money only moves if you open before the deadline—powered by EIP-3009 (deferred authorization) and our Self-x402 Facilitator.

Primary CTA: Open your inbox
Secondary CTA: See how it works

Tiny reassurance line:
No escrow. No subscription. Funds stay with the sender until you open.

⸻

Two audiences (split section)

For receivers (wallet owners)
	•	Set your minimum price.
	•	Get a queue of open bids.
	•	Open → instant USDC to your wallet. Ignore or let bids expire—no action needed.

For senders
	•	Message any wallet address—no prior signup.
	•	See a live price guide (min/P25/median/P75).
	•	Sign a gasless authorization (EIP-3009). Pay only if they open.

⸻

How it works (3 steps each)

Sender
	1.	Choose a recipient wallet (or username) and enter your bid.
	2.	Sign an EIP-3009 authorization (no on-chain tx; no USDC leaves your wallet).
	3.	Your message sits pending. If the receiver opens before the deadline, USDC transfers. If not, the authorization expires—no refund needed.

Receiver
	1.	Visit with your wallet to claim your inbox (simple signature).
	2.	See pending bids sorted by amount and reputation facts.
	3.	Open to accept (settles on-chain) or ignore and let it expire.

⸻

Why x4pp is different
	•	Open bidding, not fixed fees: senders pick their price; receivers decide.
	•	No custodial escrow: the authorization itself is the escrow (EIP-3009).
	•	Gasless for senders: a typed-data signature authorizes USDC; the receiver (or relayer) pays gas on accept.
	•	Any wallet can be messaged: even if they’ve never used x4pp; they can claim later and accept.
	•	Privacy-first: we don’t move funds or expose data unless the receiver opens.

⸻

Under the hood (tech & innovation)
	•	Celo mainnet + USDC (6 decimals): fast, low-cost stablecoin rails.
	•	EIP-3009 (TransferWithAuthorization): sender signs a deferred voucher; we replay it exactly on open.
	•	Self-x402 Facilitator: verifies and stores vouchers; settles them only upon acceptance—aligns with the x402 deferred scheme.
	•	(Optional later) Self verification discount tiers (ZK human proofs) and anti-sybil controls.

⸻

FAQ (short answers)
	•	Do I pay gas to send? No. You sign a typed-data authorization; gas is paid on the receiver’s accept (relayer can cover).
	•	What if the receiver never opens? Your authorization expires at the deadline; no USDC moves.
	•	Can I message any wallet? Yes. If they haven’t joined x4pp yet, your bid sits pending; they can claim later and accept.
	•	Is my money safe while pending? Yes—USDC stays in your wallet. The signed voucher is only usable as-is and only before its expiry.
	•	What prevents abuse? One active bid per sender→recipient, blocklists, and reputation facts.

⸻

Visual/layout tips (fast wins)
	•	Show a mock inbox with two pending cards: “$0.12 • 23h left” and “$0.34 • 6h left”.
	•	Opposite side: the sender flow with a price guide mini-chart (Min / P25 / Median / P75).
	•	Keep the tech box compact with recognizable badges: Celo, USDC, EIP-3009, x402.

Micro-copy you can reuse in the UI
	•	Banner (reassurance): “No funds move unless you open.”
	•	Guide hint: “Most bids land $p25–$p75 (median $median). Minimum $min.”
	•	Pending card: “$0.34 • 6h left • From @alice • ‘Project intro…’”
	•	Empty state (receiver): “Your inbox is ready. Share your wallet to start receiving paid DMs.”

⸻

Quick self-audit (5 minutes)
	•	Can a first-time visitor explain x4pp in one sentence after 5 seconds?
	•	Is there a single CTA that reflects the main job?
	•	Are “how it works” steps visible without scrolling too far?
	•	Does the page explicitly say USDC on Celo, EIP-3009 deferred authorization, x402-style facilitator?
	•	Does it explain no funds move unless opened?
	•	Do you show a live example or animation of a pending bid?
	•	Do OG tags render a clean preview on Twitter/Telegram/Discord?
