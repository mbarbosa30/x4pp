Step-by-Step Implementation Plan for Building the Reputation System in x4pp
With the new context of x4pp—a P2P messaging app where senders bid USDC on Celo for receivers’ attention, using EIP-3009 for gasless authorizations—the reputation system (e.g., an “Attention Score” from 0-100) can enhance trust and dynamics. It ties into existing flows: higher scores for receivers could lower min bids or prioritize their inbox visibility; for senders, good reps could influence bid acceptance rates. This builds on x4pp’s tech stack (React/TS frontend with Wagmi/Viem, Express backend with Postgres/Drizzle, Celo mainnet), and incorporates Self Protocol verification (from JulioMCruz’s Self-x402 repo) for Sybil-resistant unique nullifiers. We’ll assume the frontend at https://Attention-Protocol.replit.app is a minimal prototype (e.g., landing page with basic UI), as browsing shows insufficient content—likely needing expansion for chat/inbox features.
The MVP focuses on a simple, privacy-preserving score: based on response timeliness, bid acceptance rates, and tips, stored onchain via Celo for verifiability. Use ZK proofs (inspired by Self-x402 and ShadowVault) to prove score thresholds without revealing details. Prototype in 1-2 weeks, starting today (October 21, 2025), aligning with Self ZK Residency timelines.
Prerequisites
	•	Dev Environment: Node.js (v18+), Yarn/NPM, Git, PostgreSQL (via Neon as in x4pp), MetaMask for Celo testnet, code editor (VS Code). Access to Replit for frontend forks.
	•	Repo Setup: Fork JulioMCruz’s Self-x402 (for verification/micropayments), Infinity (AI automation for scoring), ShadowVault (ZK privacy), SnapCoffee (tipping flows). If x4pp has a public repo (not mentioned; assume private), clone locally or start from Replit export.
	•	Time/Cost: 15-25 hours for MVP. Free on testnet; ~$50 for mainnet gas (low on Celo).
	•	Assumptions: Frontend is React-based with routes (/inbox, /app); backend has /api endpoints. Add nullifier verification via Self if not present.
Step 1: Set Up Workspace and Integrate Verification (2-3 hours)
	•	Goal: Ensure users are unique humans for Sybil-proof scoring.
	•	Actions:
	◦	Fork Replit project (https://Attention-Protocol.replit.app) or create a new Next.js Repl if empty. Run locally: yarn dev.
	◦	Clone Self-x402 and copy verification modules: Add @selfxyz/qrcode and @selfxyz/backend to yarn deps.
	◦	Frontend: In the registration flow (e.g., /signup), add a “Verify with Self” button—generate QR for passport scan, store ZK proof/nullifier in localStorage/session.
	◦	Backend: Extend Express server (e.g., routes/users.ts) with /api/verify endpoint: Validate proof against Self’s Celo contract (0xe57F…5BF), store nullifier in users table (add column: nullifier bytes32).
	◦	Tie to x4pp: Require verification for scoring eligibility; unverified users default to score 0.
	•	Test: Simulate QR scan; check Postgres for nullifier. Deploy to Replit.
Step 2: Define and Deploy Reputation Smart Contract on Celo (3-4 hours)
	•	Goal: Onchain storage for tamper-proof scores, integrated with EIP-3009 payments.
	•	Actions:
	◦	Create /contracts folder in backend/monorepo.
	◦	Write Reputation.sol (Solidity, cap at 100 for simplicity): // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
	◦	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	◦	
	◦	contract AttentionReputation {
	◦	    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public scores; // Nullifier hash -> score
	◦	    address public facilitator; // Backend address
	◦	
	◦	    constructor(address _facilitator) {
	◦	        facilitator = _facilitator;
	◦	    }
	◦	
	◦	    modifier onlyFacilitator() {
	◦	        require(msg.sender == facilitator, "Unauthorized");
	◦	        _;
	◦	    }
	◦	
	◦	    function updateScore(bytes32 nullifierHash, int256 delta) external onlyFacilitator {
	◦	        int256 newScore = int256(scores[nullifierHash]) + delta;
	◦	        scores[nullifierHash] = uint256(newScore < 0 ? 0 : newScore > 100 ? 100 : newScore);
	◦	    }
	◦	
	◦	    function getScore(bytes32 nullifierHash) external view returns (uint256) {
	◦	        return scores[nullifierHash];
	◦	    }
	◦	}
	◦	
	◦	Deploy: Use Hardhat/Viem (add deps: yarn add hardhat viem). Config hardhat.js with Celo testnet RPC (https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org). Run npx hardhat deploy --network alfajores.
	◦	Integrate: In backend, after EIP-3009 accept/decline, call updateScore (e.g., +10 for accept, -5 for decline).
	•	Test: Use Viem to update/view scores; verify on alfajores.celoscan.io.
Step 3: Implement Backend Scoring Logic (4-5 hours)
	•	Goal: Compute scores offchain, settle onchain, tied to messaging flows.
	•	Actions:
	◦	Extend DB Schema (Drizzle/Postgres): Add reputation table: userId, nullifierHash, lastUpdated. Link to messages/payments.
	◦	Add /api/rep/update endpoint: Trigger post-message actions (e.g., on /accept: delta = + (bidUsd * 2) + timeliness bonus if < SLA hours).
	◦	Metrics:
	▪	+15 for accepting bids (encourage engagement).
	▪	+5 for timely responses (check acceptedAt - sentAt).
	▪	-3 for declines/expiries (penalize selectivity).
	▪	AI Boost (from Infinity): Simple sentiment analysis on messages (use basic JS libs like compromise for text; +bonus if positive).
	▪	Decay: Cron job (every 24h) to -2% via updateScore.
	◦	Privacy: Use ShadowVault-inspired encryption for raw ratings; ZK proofs (Circom) for threshold queries (e.g., prove “score >70”).
	◦	Payment Tie-In: On EIP-3009 execute, auto-update sender/receiver scores.
	•	Test: Run server (node server.js), simulate accept/decline, check DB/contract.
Step 4: Update Frontend for Scoring UI and Integration (4-5 hours)
	•	Goal: Display scores in inbox/compose, influence bidding.
	•	Actions:
	◦	Use TanStack Query/Wagmi: Add hook to fetch score via Viem (query getScore with nullifierHash).
	◦	UI Components (Shadcn/Tailwind):
	▪	Profile: Show “Attention Score: X/100” badge.
	▪	Inbox: Sort pending bids by sender’s score (higher = top); tooltip: “High rep sender”.
	▪	Compose: Show receiver’s score in price guide; suggest bids based on it (e.g., +20% for low-rep receivers).
	▪	Boost: High-score users get UI perks (e.g., auto-highlight messages).
	◦	Verification Prompt: If unverified, modal for Self QR.
	◦	P2P Market Tie: Link score to minBasePrice (e.g., auto-adjust min for high-rep users).
	•	Test: E2E: Verify, send bid, accept, see score update in UI.
Step 5: Add Advanced Features and Security (2-3 hours)
	•	Goal: Polish for MVP.
	•	Actions:
	◦	ZK Thresholds: Add button to generate/prove “High Rep” (via Self-x402 circuits).
	◦	AI Automation: From Infinity, automate decay/bonuses in backend worker.
	◦	SnapCoffee Integration: For reply bounties, add score boosts on tip receipt.
	◦	Security: Validate nullifiers on all updates; expiry worker for unused auths (as in x4pp).
	•	Test: Check edge cases (e.g., Sybil attempt fails).
Step 6: Full Testing, Deployment, and Launch (2-3 hours)
	•	Goal: Go live with initial version.
	•	Actions:
	◦	Testing: Unit (Jest for backend), E2E (Cypress for frontend). Simulate full flows on testnet.
	◦	Deployment: Backend to Vercel/Neon; contract to Celo mainnet; frontend to Replit/Vercel.
	◦	Monitoring: Log tx hashes; use Celo explorer.
	◦	Iteration: Post-MVP: Cross-chain from CrossMint-Challenge; more AI from Infinity.
	•	Launch: Start with test users; announce via Julio’s networks (e.g., ETHGlobal-style demo).
Begin with Step 1 immediately—fork Replit and add verification. This integrates seamlessly with x4pp’s bidding, making the attention market more trusted. Track progress daily; aim for MVP by October 28, 2025. If issues with Replit (e.g., empty content), bootstrap a basic React app mirroring the doc. Let’s iterate!
